d. Display all unique courses across students
e. Filter students enrolled in a specific course

3. Use the followings
a. Use useState
b. Use Map internally for id to student mapping
c. Use Set for course uniqueness

e. Do not mutate state directly
f. Use spread operator for updates
g. Convert Set to array before rendering

4. Compute time complexity of filtering students by course
